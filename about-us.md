I am a freelance software developer, work with Ruby on Rails and live in Berlin. I enjoy most to work in a small company with a pragmatic approach.

My professional career started in 1996. This gives me more than 19 years of experience.

In my first Job, I joined Netlife. I became Netlife's vice president of product development and stayed until after their IPO.

In 2009, I cofounded Balao, the company who built GratisPay, and worked as its CTO. We sold Balao in 1/2010 to Fyber.

From 2010-2013 I was CTO and cofounder of [Papersmart](http://www.papersmart.de).

Today I work as a freelancer.

## Areas of Interest

I am most interested in

*  Ruby on Rails
*  Developer happiness (better ways of working together such as agile development, practices that let development work remain a joy)
*  Small internet business (micropreneur, bootstrapped)


## Publications

I have written two books:

The first book is **Go To JavaServer Pages**. Addison Wesley published it in 2001. At the [Amazon page](http://www.amazon.de/Go-To-Java-Server-Pages/dp/3827318920) you can find an overview and reader reviews

My second book is **Spring and Hibernate**. It introduces Spring and Hibernate, and how these two technologies play together in a typical project. Please see [Amazon's page](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3446404570/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d3_i1?pf_rd_m=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0P56H03D28KJQY6D23CF&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=455353687&pf_rd_i=301128). Hanser published the second edition in April 2008.


## Availability

From 1.8.2015 on I will be available for 3-4 days per week for projects in Berlin.
